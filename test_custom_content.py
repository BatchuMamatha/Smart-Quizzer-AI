Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.

Key concepts in AI include:
1. Supervised Learning: Training models using labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error with rewards
4. Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language
5. Computer Vision: Interpreting and analyzing visual information
