> 📖 **For detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting, and manual installation**, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

### � **Default Test Credentials**

The setup script creates 20 users (5 admins + 15 regular users):

**Admin Accounts:**
| Username | Password | Name |
|----------|----------|------|
| ravi | Admin@123 | Ravi Kumar |
| sneha | Admin@123 | Sneha Reddy |
| arjun | Admin@123 | Arjun Mehta |
| divya | Admin@123 | Divya Patel |
| rahul | Admin@123 | Rahul Sharma |

**Sample User Accounts:**
| Username | Password | Name | Skill Level |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| priya | User@123 | Priya Nair | Beginner |
| anjali | User@123 | Anjali Das | Beginner |
| vikram | User@123 | Vikram Singh | Intermediate |
| neha | User@123 | Neha Bansal | Intermediate |
| deepak | User@123 | Deepak Gupta | Advanced |

*15 user accounts total with varying skill levels. See `init_database.py` for complete list.*

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: These are test credentials. Change admin passwords before deploying to production!
| john | password123 | john@example.com | user |
| demo | demo123 | demo@smartquizzer.com | user |

### 🔧 **Manual Installation**

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BatchuMamatha/Smart-Quizzer-AI.git
   cd Smart-Quizzer-AI
   ```

2. **Setup Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Configure environment
   # Copy .env.example to .env and add your Gemini API key
   
   # Go back to root and initialize database
   cd ..
   python init_database.py
   
   # Start backend
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```
   Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Setup Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Login & Start!**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Login with one of the default users above
   - Or register a new account

### ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

**"Invalid credentials" error after cloning?**
```bash
# SOLUTION: Initialize the database with default users
python init_database.py

# The script will verify credentials and show:
# ✅ alice: Login will work
# ✅ john: Login will work
# ✅ admin: Login will work
# ✅ demo: Login will work
```

**Still getting "Invalid credentials"?**
1. Make sure you ran `init_database.py` from the **project root directory** (not from backend/)
2. Check the script output - it should show "✅ ALL CREDENTIALS VERIFIED"
3. Make sure backend dependencies are installed: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Verify database file exists: `backend/instance/smart_quizzer.db`
5. Try the exact credentials shown in the table above (username & password are case-sensitive)

**Registration not working?**
1. Ensure backend is running (http://localhost:5000)
2. Check that `.env` file exists with valid Gemini API key
3. Clear browser cache and sessionStorage (F12 → Application → Clear Storage)
4. Check backend console for error messages

**Backend won't start?**
1. Make sure you're in the backend directory: `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check `.env` file has your Gemini API key
4. Look for error messages in the console
